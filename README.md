# Bursty Repository

## Introduction 

This project is a implementation of the burst detection model, which was proposed by Jon Kleinberg in 2002 in the paper
> Kleinberg, Jon. "Bursty and hierarchical structure in streams." Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 7.4 (2003): 373-397.

You can find more details about the paper and experiments from <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd02.html> 

Burst detection model identifies time periods (**bursts**) in a document streams. A burst indicates the appearance of a topic, which emerges accompanied with certain features rising sharply in frequency.   

The approach is based on modeling the stream using an **infinite-state automaton**, in which bursts appear naturally as *state transitions*.
